# Claude Rules

## Workflow Process

1. **Think and Plan**
   - First think through the problem
   - Read the codebase for relevant files
   - Write a plan to tasks/todo.md


2. **Verify Before Starting**
   - Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan

3. **Execute and Track**
   - Begin working on the todo items
   - Mark them as complete as you go

4. **Communication**
   - Every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made

5. **Simplicity First**
   - Make every task and code change as simple as possible
   - Avoid making any massive or complex changes
   - Every change should impact as little code as possible
   - Everything is about simplicity

6. **Review**
   - Add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information

## Core Principles

7. **DO NOT BE LAZY**
   - NEVER BE LAZY
   - IF THERE IS A BUG FIND THE ROOT CAUSE AND FIX IT
   - NO TEMPORARY FIXES
   - YOU ARE A SENIOR DEVELOPER
   - NEVER BE LAZY

8. **SIMPLICITY ABOVE ALL**
   - MAKE ALL FIXES AND CODE CHANGES AS SIMPLE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE
   - THEY SHOULD ONLY IMPACT NECESSARY CODE RELEVANT TO THE TASK AND NOTHING ELSE
   - IT SHOULD IMPACT AS LITTLE CODE AS POSSIBLE
   - YOUR GOAL IS TO NOT INTRODUCE ANY BUGS
   - IT'S ALL ABOUT SIMPLICITY
